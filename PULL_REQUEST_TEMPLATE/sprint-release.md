# Sprint <number>
> Any section marked with \* is required to be completed before merging (and closing) this sprint [read: pr]

A broad overview of what we are tackling this week.. This is informed by what everyone wants to work on this sprint as mentioned during the _daily-15_ call.

## Issues\*
> Link any issues that you want tackled, below. Do this at the start of the sprint by opening a pr into `dev` from a new branch `sprint-<number>`

1. #...
2. #...

## Pull Requests\*
> Throughout the sprint, add in PRs below; as a rule of thumb, all these PRs should be closed at the end of te sprint.

1. #..., which closes #...
2. #..., which fixes #...

## Changelog\*
> As PRs are closed above, the expectation is that ***all three**, ie, the developer(s), the reveiwer(s), and the person merging mention the changes. They may not always need to, but every member who was involved in the PR should make sure the PR is complete and the changelog below is comprehensive. Link the related PR as well.

1. Example change (#...)
2. Example change (#...)
  i. Related sub-change
3. Another example change (#)

## Carryover\*
> Before merging this PR, ensure that all the issues linked above have associated PRs below them, _and_ that those PRs are closed. If not, move those issues from above to here and remove the PR from the list above (so github does not close the issue automatically). Check the boxes when successfully included in a later sprint. This will likely be automated.

- [ ] #.. carried over because ...
- [ ] #.. with the associated pr #...

## Notes
> Use this section to jot down any related thoughts which are not necessarily issues.
