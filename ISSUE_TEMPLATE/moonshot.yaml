        Oh? Do you have an idea that is big? Some observation leading to some insight leading to some connection, leading to here! _How exciting!_

        - [feature] something is missing
        - [ux] something is confusing or can be delightful
        - [ui] like ux, but for ui
        - or [codebase] something that is more internal
